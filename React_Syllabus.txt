SSR




An SPA (Single-page application) is a web app implementation that loads only a single web document, and then updates the body content of that single document via JavaScript APIs such as XMLHttpRequest and Fetch when different content is to be shown.



A single-page application is an app that works inside a browser and does not require page reloading during use.
